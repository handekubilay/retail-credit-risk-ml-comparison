## 📌 Overview

This project explores and compares the performance of three supervised machine learning models for retail credit risk prediction:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**

Key stages include:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Handling class imbalance using **SMOTE**
- Model training, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning  
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and log loss
